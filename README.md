CS1635 Designing, Prototyping and Evaluating Mobile Interfaces

StudyBuddies

Task 1 - Easy: Sign on and choose a username. Requires the user to enter a username upon being prompted when first opening the app.

Task 2 - Medium: Answer a question, then view the answered question. Requires navigating to a group home page, selecting the "Answer a Question" button then entering an answer. Then choosing the "View Recent Answers" button from the group home page and checking the answer.

Task 3 - Hard: Create a study-group. Requires the user to select the "Study Groups" button from a group home page then selecting the "+" button and entering custom attributes for the study group.

Limitations
-There is no cloud backend support. We offer the ability to save favorites and username to shared preferences. If we were to implement the cloud backend we would have saved the groups to the cloud and that would have been it, because the users would have taken care of everything else. 
-Would like to have come up with a better ranking procedure.
